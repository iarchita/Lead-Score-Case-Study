# Lead-Score-Case-Study
**OBJECTIVE** :

An education company, X Education, offers online courses tailored for industry professionals. Each day, numerous professionals visit their website, attracted by the company’s marketing efforts on platforms like Google and other websites. Upon landing on the website, visitors may browse courses, fill out forms to express interest, or watch course-related videos. When someone provides their email address or phone number via a form, they are classified as a lead. X Education also acquires leads through referrals.Once leads are acquired, the sales team engages with them through calls, emails, and other communication methods. However, the conversion rate is low—typically around 30%. For instance, out of 100 leads generated in a day, only about 30 convert into actual customers. To improve efficiency, X Education aims to identify the most promising leads, referred to as "Hot Leads." By focusing efforts on these potential leads, the company hopes to increase its conversion rate.To achieve this, a logistic regression model will be built to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead. A higher score will indicate a greater likelihood of conversion, helping the sales team prioritize these hot leads over others. This model should also be adaptable to future changes in the company’s requirements, addressing specific problems as they arise.Additionally, you are required to address further issues presented by the company in a separate document, which should be based on the initial logistic regression model. This information, along with your model's insights and recommendations, will be included in the final presentation (PPT) to ensure a comprehensive strategy for enhancing the lead conversion process.
